# Brain Vacation
          Have you been working hard and need a break to clear your mind? You've
          come to the right place! Take a few minutes and play an old-fashioned
          arcade style game.
## Instructions

          Go to the login page and enter your name. You may also choose a theme
          and a panic screen to display in case the boss walks in! Your high
          score will be recorded so you can come back later and try to beat it.

          You can just click the play game tab and play as a guest, but your
          score will not be recorded or ranked.
